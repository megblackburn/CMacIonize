Notes from Meg (mgb27@st-andrews.ac.uk)

- will need conda/python environment with packages in requirements.txt  (email me if issues)

To setup the code, follow these steps:

1. clone the repository however you want to:

Lewis McCallum's code:
git clone https://github.com/LewisSMcCallum/CMacIonize.git (anonymous download, can fork if you want)

Meg's code:
git clone https://github.com/megblackburn/CMacIonize.git

2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX -DHYDROGEN_ONLY=true | tee output_from_cmake.txt
5. make -j 16 (if own laptop probably just 'make', leave out -j)
6. (optional) make check

Code should now be compiled!

7. cd build/rundir/benchmarks/stromgren/

8. Run test:
 ../../CMacIonize --params stromgren.param --threads <number of parallel threads>

Then go through tutorials:
 https://bwvdnbro.github.io/CMacIonize/tutorials/



Notes:

- Lewis uses MixedDriving as photon source for tallbox - this is a combination of peak driving and random driving for sources
- I've added Bursty, BursyAsymmetric and StationarySFR
- Bursty works the same as MixedDriving as long as 'bursty sfr flag = false' in param file
- all of my comments and edits have 'mgb' noted in them, others are likely from Lewis
- all files controlling simulation are in src

Example parameter files are here:

- bursty_sfr_tallbox.param.used-values contains all possible parameters
- bursty_sfr_tallbox.param is an example of a parameter file I'm currently using
- I've added quick comments about the most important parameters for tallbox sims

Important files for Stellar winds:
- MixedDrivingPhotonSourceDistribution.hpp or BurstyPhotonSourceDistribution.hpp
- SupernovaHandler.hpp

Only modules I have loaded for compilation are:
  1) slurm/23.02.6 (S)   2) lmod
