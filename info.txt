Lewis McCallum's code:
git clone https://github.com/LewisSMcCallum/CMacIonize.git (anonymous download, can fork if you want)

Meg's code:
git clone https://github.com/megblackburn/CMacIonize.git

2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX -DHYDROGEN_ONLY=true | tee output_from_cmake.txt
5. make -j 16
6. (optional) make check

Code should now be compiled!

Run test:
 ../../CMacIonize --params stromgren.param --threads <number of parallel threads>

Then go through tutorials:

Notes:

- Lewis uses MixedDriving as photon source
- I've added Bursty, BursyAsymmetric and StationarySFR
- Bursty works the same as MixedDriving as long as 'bursty sfr flag = false' in param file
- all of my comments and edits have 'mgb' noted in them, others are likely from Lewis
