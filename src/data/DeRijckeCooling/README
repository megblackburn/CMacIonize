Supporting Information accompanying the paper "New composition
  dependent cooling and heating curves for galaxy evolution
  simulations", S. De Rijcke, J. Schroyen, B. Vandenbroucke,
  N. Jachowicz, J. Decroos, A. Cloet-Osselaer, and M. Koleva.

The names of the files with the cooling and heating rates encode the
parameter values for which the rates were calculated:

RadLoss_val1_val2_val3_val4.rates

contains the rates for Iron abundance       [Fe/H]  = val1
                       Magnesium-Iron ratio [Mg/Fe] = val2
		       redshift                z    = val3
		       Hydrogen number density nH   = val4

The zero-metallicity curves are labeled with [Fe/H]=-99.00 and
[Mg/Fe]=0.0, such as "RadLoss_-99.00_0.00_0.50_1.00e-03.rates".

The first number in each file gives the gas density in
grams/cm^3. Then follows a table of three columns:

temperature (in Kelvin)  |  cooling rate (in erg/cm^3/sec)  | heating rate (in erg/cm^3/sec)

Additional notes:

Note that we only include the solar metallicity, high-redshift curve.
